# TestGen

TestGen is a command-line utility written in Go that automatically generates test files with simple body for a provided Go file.

# Features

- Automatically generates test file (`*_test.go`) for a given Go source file.
- Creates test function templates for all __exported functions and methods__ found in the file.
- Determines the appropriate test structure based on the complexity of the function:
    - For simple logic: generates a basic test function.
    - For functions with multiple branches: generates a table-driven test function.
- When generating tests for methods of a struct, it analyzes the structâ€™s fields:
    - For any field that is of interface usertype, it automatically generates field initialization by mock.
